        <strong id='stronger'>I am a programmer with a BA in Psychology that's interested in web development and data analysis.</strong> I work at an architectural firm where I produce PR videos, draft from time to time, and am currently working on their new website. I am also a photographer and musician that plays lute, ukulele, and guitar. Whether studying code, analyzing data or creating websites, or simply enjoying some free time playing Early music or Caetano Veloso, I find that a dedication to technical proficiency is a must if you hope to produce something beautiful. Combining my knowledge of music, art, and Psychology, with my new found loves of programming and data analysis, has been life-affirming.
