        <strong id='stronger'>I'm a programmer with a Psychology degree who plays guitar, lute, and ukulele.</strong>
        I find studying code, analyzing data, and creating websites, similar to playing music. As I hone my technical skills, whether playing Early music, Caetano Veloso, or creating an app, the results become more beautiful. I also work at an architectural firm where in addition to drafting I create publicity videos using Super 8 analog film and digital editing software. For some of the videos, I compose original music. Combining my knowledge of music, art, and Psychology, with my new found loves of programming and data analysis, has been life-affirming.
