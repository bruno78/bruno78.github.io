        <title>Create-Angular-Components Tool</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to demonstrate a useful tool that will help you speed up your process when creating Angular applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working with mockups or one page templates like Bootstrap, the task of creating each individual component, and then cutting and pasting each template section, can become cumbersome. Imagine if you’re using Angular-cli, and for each component you have to issue a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ng g component my-new-component&lt;/code&gt; command plus cut and paste. Is there an easier way? Yes! That’s when the create-angular-components tool comes into action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-things-first&quot;&gt;First Things First&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this demonstration, I’m assuming you already have angular-cli and/or have your Angular app installed. If not, please follow these &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#generating-components-directives-pipes-and-services&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your application up and running, let’s install the create-angular-components tool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install -g create-angular-components
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed the steps above accurately, your Angular application tree structure should be similar to my below structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/cac-init-tree-structure.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-template-file&quot;&gt;Using the Template File&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a very simple example of a html mockup or one page template that I copied to the app folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;my-app
  └── src
      └── app
          └── template.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I decided to call it template.html instead of index.html so not to confuse the file with the same name on the src folder. But you can call it anything you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/cac-templatefile.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it’s structured in these following sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;- nav&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;- section
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;- about&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;- portfolio content&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;- footer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above html elements are the parts I want to transform into components and subcomponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up&quot;&gt;Setting Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all we have to do is mark up the html elements we want to transform into components by adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;data-component=&quot;ComponentName&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Don’t forget: use CamelCase!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/cac-markedupfile.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;firing-up-the-command&quot;&gt;Firing Up the Command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all elements are marked with data-component attributes, it’s time to issue the command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the command line, if you are not on your app’s root folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;my-app
cac template.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…drum roll…
et voilá!&lt;/em&gt; If everything runs successfully you will see a message stating that 5 components were generated (3 components and 2 subcomponents) into &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/Users/user-name/my-app/src/app&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the final result of your folder tree, you should have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/cac-treefinalresult.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;about.component.html&lt;/code&gt; you should see all the content of the ‘about’ from your template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;about&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;About me&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is your about.component.ts with the started code ready to be populated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'@angular/core'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'about'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;templateUrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./about.component.html'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;styleUrls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'./about.component.css'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;AboutComponent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does it generate a folder with the name you’ve specified in the data-component attribute, including the TypeScript file, css file, html file with your content, but also the unit test file. Pretty cool, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also your template.html file remains intact. You can either remove it or redo your components whenever you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s it for today. The repo for this demonstration can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bruno78/cac-app&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big thank you to Alexey Okhrimenko (@aiboy on Github) for creating this great tool, and if you want to visit his github page or see the repo, please go &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/aiboy/create-angular-components&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Rosemont NYC Bar</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client wanted to rebrand their existing jazz bar to become a gay bar with jazz nights and so needed a new website that would convey the new direction. The rebranding, general look and functionality of the new website, would need to continue to appeal to the older jazz crowd while drawing new and younger gay patrons. They also wanted the new website to feature their new events schedule: Jazz performances on Tuesdays, drag shows on Wednesdays and Saturdays, Queer/Rock’n’Roll music on Fridays, and art shows on Sundays. In general, the idea was to create a “classy but edgy” new persona and website for the bar that would appeal to art loving patrons of both jazz and gay culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;important-client-statements&quot;&gt;Important Client Statements:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initially, “Owners were switching from a jazz bar to a mix jazz bar/queer friendly bar - keep it classy”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During development, “Owners wanted to gradually end the jazz bar and become a gay bar”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“They wanted a website to display the bar schedule, environment, people and backyard”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“The current website had too much scrolling”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“They wanted the drink menu displayed prominently on the front page”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problems&quot;&gt;Problems:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The website had too much scrolling on the front page.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The client wanted to make sure people would come to the website and immediately see the - drink menu.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Information wasn’t being displayed clearly and correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/old-rosemontnyc.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;old website (each block is what is displayed on the screen as you scroll down)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;possible-solutions&quot;&gt;Possible Solutions:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Transfer the music listings to a separate events page.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Put a detailed drink menu on the front page.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Distribute information in the proper locations.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add a header containing the logo and hours.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Display content on a jumbotron, with drink menu on homepage, and a navigation bar to about and events.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Add a footer containing access to social-media, with bar phone number and email address.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;design-evolution&quot;&gt;Design Evolution:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While waiting for new photographs of the bar to be supplied by the client, it was difficult to create a new design as the color palette of the old photographs were so distinct. Also, the burgundy, grey and brown colors of areas around the photographs, hindered the development of the new look. Once new photographs were taken, which I was eventually hired to do, going to the bar on a performance night with the laser lights and gay culture in full swing, the design for the new website finally started to take shape. The new photographs changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/therosemontnyc-evolution.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;trying to distance from the old color palette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also during the design process, the manager changed his mind on the general concept, he no longer wanted to retain jazz nights but instead simply become a gay/queer friendly bar every night of the week. No more “classy”, instead he wanted the website to convey a “vibrant and fun” atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-result&quot;&gt;Final Result:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/therosemontnyc.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the new website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When opening the website home page, using a regular desktop computer, users see a gif of laser lights behind a photographic slideshow on the right and a drink menu on the left. The home page gives one the sense of actually standing at the bar preparing to order a drink and watch a performance. The laser light gif in the background, photos of the bar and patrons on one side, and the drink menu on the other. The website’s menu bar is located under the slideshow, with links to Events, About and Contact pages. The footer contains links to social media outlets, contact information as well as the address with a link to the map. Both the header and footer have black backgrounds so they blend nicely into the blackness of the background laser light gif, tying everything together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The events’ page has a full screen background photograph showing a drag queen during a performance, setting the mood of the page. An events api lays on top of the photograph, displaying all the events for the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The about’s page has another full screen photograph in the background showing a drag queen performing. Overlaying the background photo, is a brief description of the newly rebranded bar, on the right side, with a photograph slideshow on the right side, showing patrons happily mingling and ordering drinks and attending events. The about page clearly conveys the newly rebranded lively atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Contact’s page has the same background as the about’s page. It contains a contact form so users can put their info and send a message. There is also a map showing the location of the bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/therosemontnyc-admin.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;instructions to customize the content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I created a user friendly content management interface, for each page. The interface allows the client to change photos and written information as wanted, able to update events and keep the website as lively as the bar itself. This also minimized any ongoing website maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Offline First - No Internet connection and it's ok!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Going to Meetups is a good way to learn more about upcoming technologies. Of late, I’ve enjoyed learning how to develop mobile apps using JavaScript. One concept that interested me is &lt;em&gt;Offline First&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;no-internet-connection&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No Internet connection!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you tried to open an app with little or no internet connection and the first thing you see is this error message: “No internet connection”? At that point, you know it’s over; you can’t use your application until you get a network signal. Well, Offline First solves this problem. The idea is to create apps that will still work even when you have flakey or non-existent connection. That said, the technology doesn’t do anything miraculous; it just stores the right amount of data to keep your app working no matter the circumstances. For example, if you are on a subway with no Internet connection and you decide to open your Offline-First twitter feed app, it will show you the tweets from the last time it was synchronized with the internet. As soon as you have connection again, it will update without your having to do anything. All it actually does is, instead of giving you a “no connection error”, it gives you the data from it’s last internet sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offline First uses a JavaScript database named PouchDB which is a trunked down version of Apache’s CouchDB (which you can also use) and it runs within your browser/app. The advantage of these apps are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s faster since all the CRUD operations happens within your app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It supposedly takes less battery and bandwidth because data is synchronized periodically, in batches instead of constantly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The main and foremost: it works offline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offline First apps are good for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frontend Web apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backend Web apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desktop apps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Internet of Things (IoT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about Offline First or go for test drive, give a shot using Hoodie, a nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://hood.ie/initiatives/#nobackend&quot;&gt;noBackend&lt;/a&gt; framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hood.ie/&quot;&gt;http://hood.ie/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or if you are looking for something more lightweight as in a script, Up Up is your way to go:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How have Americans' views changed regarding gun control through the years?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time a major gun incident occurs, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting&quot;&gt;Orlando mass shooting&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/01/toddlers-have-shot-at-least-23-people-this-year&quot;&gt;toddlers accidentally shooting themselves or their loved ones&lt;/a&gt;, there tends to be a public outcry asking why we don’t have stricter gun control laws, yet legislation is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s ironic to note that while some laws, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.patheos.com/blogs/formerlyfundie/the-disgusting-hypocrisy-of-the-anti-trans-bathroom-movement/&quot;&gt;laws&lt;/a&gt; regarding who can and cannot use what public bathroom are passed in some states post haste, the same demographic often tends to oppose stricter gun control laws so vehemently that those laws are never passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News outlets often portray public opinion as being highly divided despite the data actually showing otherwise. For example, Fox News often presents the false claim that people who support gun control want to take peoples guns away &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/06/06/four-ways-president-hillary-clinton-will-work-to-end-gun-ownership.html&quot;&gt;the government will take away their guns&lt;/a&gt;. Other news outlets often oversimplify the issue, targeting specific arguments &lt;a href=&quot;http://csgv.org/issues/guns-and-mental-health/&quot;&gt;stricter gun laws would not allow people with a history of mental illness to purchase them&lt;/a&gt;. It was these kinds of politically-biased and oversimplified reports that led me to want to know more about the actual statistics regarding percentages of American’s supporting/opposing gun control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opinions-on-gun-permits&quot;&gt;Opinions on Gun Permits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gss.norc.org/&quot;&gt;General Social Survey&lt;/a&gt; dataset, 1972-2014, perhaps the biggest surprise, in general, was that across the entire survey period the percentage of Americans that favored gun permits never fell below 70%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/gunlaw-opinion.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data shows there were four peaks during which gun permits were viewed more favorably. The first peak was during the period from 1972 to 1974, the highest point being in 1974 at 76.1% favorable. Then favorability dropped to 70.8% in 1980. In 1982 it rose again to 74.2% but then went back down to 72.4% in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The longest and largest relative rise was sustained from 1987 to 1993 during which support for gun permits increases substantially, almost 10% compared to approximately 3% during the other peaks. Similarly, in the opposite direction, from 1998 to 2014 there was a continuous decline in favorable opinions, reaching a low of 72.3% in 2014. It’s interesting to note that that percentage is almost the same as when the survey was first stated in 1972, 42 years prior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next question, was what current events correlated with the peaks and valleys in favorable opinion?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mass-shootings-vs-opinions-on-gun-permits&quot;&gt;Mass Shootings vs Opinions on Gun Permits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map&quot;&gt;Mother Jones Investigation on Mass Shootings&lt;/a&gt; is a possible way to answer this question. Their data only covers the time period from 1982 to 2016 but provides some interesting insights. For instance, 58% of mass shootings were committed by whites, with 55% of those having prior signs of possible mental health illnesses. 79% of the weapons used by mass shooters were acquired legally. This data supports the argument that stricter background checks that search mental heath histories, might prevent some mass shootings. This data may also help to explain, in terms of the rise in frequency and severity of mass shootings, the peaks in support for gun permits between 1987 and 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/mass_shootings-vs-gunlaws.svg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to look at this case would be, whenever there are no mass shootings or lower numbers of victims, the number of people supporting gun permits goes down because people are either not thinking about the issue, or during those times people don’t associate buying a gun as much with mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might think, when a mass shooting occurs, the number of people in favor of gun regulations would rise. It is certainly a logical deduction but as we’ve found with the data it is not a conclusion that we can make with any degree of certainty, at least, not one we can make with our comparison alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s possible that the tipping point of raising support for gun permits in 1984 stemmed from a mass shooting where James Oliver Huberty, 41 years old, opened fire in a McDonald’s restaurant in San Ysidro, California killing 22 people and injuring 19, before being killed himself by a police office. The incident is known as San Ysidro McDonald’s massacre and there were 41 victims in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that shooting, there was at least one shooting every year from 1984 through 1993, with four mass shooting occurring in 1993 alone. Support for gun permits increased throughout this period. The Long Island Rail Road shootings in Garden City NY alone left 25 victims, the most of that period. Soon after that though, support for gun permits started to decrease, despite mass shootings continuing to occur, though on a less frequent basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Air Force base shootings occurred in 1994, with 28 victims, it was a possible tipping point for the rise in opinions again. In 1998, there were 3 mass shootings but favorability down. At this point, it seems there is a pattern where the years with only one mass shooting, a raise in favorability is sparked, while the years with three or more mass shootings, favorability goes down. One would think that more mass shootings would cause favorability to rise or at least stay the same but the opposite seems to true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2000 to 2004, where we have only one mass shooting a year, the numbers don’t go up, and in 2004, the Damageplan Gun Show Shootings seemed to trigger another raise in favorable opinions though not significantly. Then from 2006 to 2014 the numbers consistently go down, breaking all possible patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of the reason for the unexpected patterns described above, could be that when mass shootings increase within a single year, there’s a rise in the number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xUCI3nJsQ&quot;&gt;people who feel the need to protect themselves&lt;/a&gt;, and so therefore the number of people in favor of gun control goes down. It is an interesting paradox that while less strict gun control laws would make it easier for a sane person to purchase a gun, it would also make it easier for person with a history of mental illness to purchase a gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the case that gun control favorability rises, as the number of mass shootings rise, there is not a strong direct correlation. While some mass shootings may have triggered a rise in favorability that does not hold up across the period we studied. As we’ve seen there are two types of correlations. In 1984, after a mass shooting, favorability went up as would be expected. But we also found two other examples, where favorability went down after mass shootings. Therefore it’s not possible to say that there is a direst correlation between the rise in mass shootings and the rise in favorability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps looking at how the media reports shootings, and for how long shootings are covered, as well as, what kinds of people are affected by each shooting, like children in schools, perhaps that may lead to more direct proof that’s there’s a strong relationship between mass shootings and public opinion. Also, perhaps looking at the correlation between views of politicians as they are influenced by gun lobbyists, the NRA etc., perhaps a stronger determinant could be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-gss&quot;&gt;About GSS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The General Social Survey is part of the National Data Program for the Social Sciences conducted since 1972 by NORC at the University of Chicago, supported by the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://gss.norc.org/About-The-GSS&quot;&gt;GSS website&lt;/a&gt; explains that the goals of the program are twofold: “ to conduct basic scientific research on the structure and development of American society”; and “to distribute up-to-date, important, high-quality data to social scientists, students, policy makers, and others.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally the website’s homepage http://gss.norc.org/  says, “Since 1972, the General Social Survey (GSS) has provided politicians, policymakers, and scholars with a clear and unbiased perspective on what Americans think and feel about such issues as national spendi​ng priorities, crime and punishment, intergroup relations, and confidence in institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Data Program for the Social Sciences is directed by Tom W. Smith, Peter V. Marsden, and Michael Hout. It is advised by a Board of Overseers consisting of prominent social scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
