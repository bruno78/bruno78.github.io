<p>Filmed and Edited Fashion Show PR Video
<!-- excerpt --></p>

<p>This video includes both HD digital photo stills and Super 8 color film converted to digital. The filming was executed with Tim Kitchen, the art director of Rebecca Taylor (RT). The idea was to make a fun, light, and fast-paced video, highlighting the weekâ€™s work leading up to, and including, the fashion show. The editing modulates back-and-forth between the Super 8 color film and the stop-motion color stills, tightly linking all to the rhythm of the music. The video tells the story of the madcap, backstage preparations for the show, culminating in the final polished production. The video was featured on the RT website.</p>
