<p>Composed Soundscape for Architectural PR Video
<!-- excerpt --></p>

<p>I composed the soundscape for this video by Art_Bridge Architecture PLLC featuring their lobby/corridor renovation at 764 Madison Avenue NYC. The video highlights the lobby’s contemporary ‘art gallery’ aesthetic, featuring their site specific painting running throughout the stairwell. The soundtrack was composed of five layers of sounds, each given a fixed interval length and then allowed to overlap the other sounds at random. The sounds represent the various passersby as they travel up and down the stairs and corridors, passing each other along their various routes. This video is featured on the firm’s Vimeo page.</p>
