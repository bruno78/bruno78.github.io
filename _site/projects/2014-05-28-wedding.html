<p>Edited Event Video
<!-- excerpt --></p>

<p>The footage for this video was shot by my client in Super 8 film and later digitized. I then edited the footage on Adobe Premier Pro. The digitized film was problematic as it consisted mainly of short cuts that were blurry. Iâ€™ve found that a certain amount of blurriness is often present when dealing with digitized analog film. That said, with my careful editing, the final product perfectly expressed the beautiful setting and mood of the day. This video was given as a wedding gift by my client to his recently married friends.</p>
