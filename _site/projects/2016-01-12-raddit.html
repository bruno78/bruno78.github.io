<p>Prior to doing this tutorial, I tended to spend too much time focused on coding and learning how a particular app worked, rather then creating an overall plan as to how best to approach the project in general.</p>

<p>This tutorial showed me how implementing best programming practices at the beginning of a project is similar to learning how to pay music to its fullest. One not only has to be able to play each note with technical precision, but also has to equally understand the importance of the rests (silences) between the notes. And so with coding, like playing music, this tutorial taught me that you have to begin with a clear and concise outline of the goals. Music is not just a series of notes but is also the silences between. Likewise, being able to code alone, is not enough. Building a program, requires creating an overall plan before beginning to program.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this project taught me how to think through the functionalities of an application first, putting my thoughts on to paper, before beginning to program. I’ve also found that having a clear outline makes it easier to choose the right gems for the application.</p>
