Filmed, Directed, and Edited Music Video
<!-- excerpt -->

I made this music video for my former band, MTW. It was my first video "job" after film school and is a homage to Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart Again". Our schedules were tight as we all had day jobs and so I decided to simply collect all the low-fi footage from our various recordings and rehearsals, plus a showcase performance, and edit it all together. The low-fi quality of the footage lent itself well to the early 80s video aesthetic goal.
