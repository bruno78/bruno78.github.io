Composed Soundtrack for Architectural PR Video
<!-- excerpt -->

I composed the square dance style soundtrack for this stop-motion video. The video features the multimode architecture and furniture designed by Art_Bridge Architecture for Facade/Fasad, a live/work/show space in Brooklyn. The video was distributed as both a PR document for the project and as a playful seasons greetings message from the firm. The below video link is from the firm's Vimeo page.
