This program calculates and analyses, the process of finding the path between two points in a map using 3 different algorithms.
<!-- excerpt -->
For this program, 3 algorithms were implemented

1. Breadth Depth Search
2. Dijkstra
3. A* (A Star)

Once the algorithm is selected, it displays on the map all the nodes (intersections) that the algorithm is using to search the shortest path. At the end for the result, it tells the user how many nodes it used to search to get to the user.

For the A* algorithm, the Euclidian distance was selected to find the shortest path, making more efficient than Dijkstra.

The purpose of this program was solely to demonstrate the difference between the three algorithms and how efficient they are.
