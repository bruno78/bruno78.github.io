This project is part of [*Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-capstone) which is the 5th and last course of the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) by Michigan University offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).
<!-- excerpt -->

The project was divided in two parts:

*1st part: (which was part of the course)* Retrieve, process, visualize data and communicate the results, which was done entirely in Python with the visualization part in D3.js;

*2nd part: (which was not part of the course)* Compare the first dataset with another data set and create graphs done in R (for speed)

More details about the entire process can be found [here]: ADD LINK
