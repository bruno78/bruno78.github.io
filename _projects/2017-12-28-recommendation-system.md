This recommendation program uses a Collaborative Filtering system.
<!-- excerpt -->

The idea is to create recommendations specific to a user rather than the same recommendations for all users. That's accomplished by finding similarities-of-ratings between a user and other users.

The running program can be found [here](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/capstone/recommender.php?id=Rps2Qm01LkxMEX)
More on the process can be found on github: https://github.com/bruno78/recommendation-system
