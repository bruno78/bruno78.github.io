A jobsboard application
<!-- excerpt -->

This app was created under the tutorial 12 web apps in 12 weeks by Mackenzie Child (@mackenziechild). This is the 7th tutorial of the series and teaches how to create a jobs board app. I choose this tutorial out of sequence, as it related to my interests and needs at the time.

The code can be found here:
