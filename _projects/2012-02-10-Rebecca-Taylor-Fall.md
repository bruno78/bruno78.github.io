Filmed and Edited Fashion Show PR Videos
<!-- excerpt -->

These videos include digital video footage, digital stills, and Super 8 black and white film converted to digital. I filmed the Super 8 footage with Tim Kitchen, the art director of Rebecca Taylor (RT). I then edited all the footage and stills using Adobe Premier Pro. The video shows a progression from the sewing, making, and fitting of the garments, to the last minute backstage preparation with all the models and stylists. I created two versions of this video, a short-cut for the RT website and a long-cut for the RT store monitors.
