The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the process of collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set for analysis
<!-- excerpt -->

This project was the final assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course that was part of the Data Science Specialization offered by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The assignment had two data sets that had to be cleaned and merged to create a tidy data set. We had to create a codebook containing all the information about the data, including its observations and variables. We also had to create a readme file containing a list of all the files, including the R script, which lists all the commands done to clean the data for reproducing the process.
