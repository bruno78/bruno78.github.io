A classic arcade game coded in Python
<!-- excerpt -->

This classic 1972 arcade game was the final project for the course "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)" by Rice University offered on Coursera. With this project we practiced the principles of Event Driven Programming Model where you write a program that initializes and then waits for an event to occur. When the event occurs, the program accesses a function that handles the event. The program's response to the event is called a "handler". Then once the "handler" response is complete, the program waits again.

The game was coded in Python 2 and developed on a simple GUI called CodeSkulptor which is a browser-based Python interpreter created by Professor Scott Rixner. The interpreter allows a person to play the game on various web browsers.

If you want to see the code on Github:
<https://github.com/bruno78/pong.git>

If you want to play the game*:
<http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user41_VoGZTf5hOe7otdE.py>

(*) 1. It doesn't work on mobile devices. 2. Once CodeSkulptor opens don't forget to push the play button on the top left of the screen, invite a friend and play the game together. The left player uses "w" and "s" on keyboard  and right player pushes "up" and "down" keyboard arrows.

** *This course was completed in May 2016* **
