This project was the final assignment from the course “Getting Started: Agile Development Meets Design Thinking” offered by University of Virginia on Coursera.
<!-- excerpt -->
For this project I developed the first steps of a product: I wrote an introduction, brainstormed 5 personas, chose a persona and wrote about his/her life, how he/she thinks, sees, feel and does. Based on his/her story, I created a problem scenario where this persona tries to find a solution and gave a proposition that would solve the problem. Then I developed a user story that flowed from the persona, created a storyboard, developed a list of child stories with test cases (or features that would be implemented) and finally created a prototype, which displayed how the features were implemented. In this case, I designed a Kitchen Helper, a fictitious app that would help people in the kitchen with little or no cooking experience.
