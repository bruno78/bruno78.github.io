Building my website was not easy but nonetheless fun and challenging. This is a product of persistence, involving long hours of studying and searching for solutions. I learned a lot along the way and while I know I still have a lot more to learn and do, I can't wait to see what lies ahead no matter the difficulty. Thank you to everyone who helped me with this, from the bottom of my heart.

Yours Truly,

Bruno
