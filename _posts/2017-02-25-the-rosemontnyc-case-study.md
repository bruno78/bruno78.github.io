Case study: The Rosemont NYC

The Rosemont NYC

The owners of The Rosemont NYC wanted to rebrand their Williamsburg bar from a jazz bar to a gay/queer friendly bar with drag shows and performances. They wanted the website to reflect these changes. They also wanted a website they could maintain themselves, and be easy to navigate, “minimal scrolling”. The old site was built on WordPress. After I did the mockup and presented for it for approval, I designed the basic layout using html/sass. I then migrated that to WordPress as a new template and finished designing the rest of the pages. I used three plugins: 1. Bootstrap Helper (for the menu bar); 2. Ninja Contact Form (for the contact page); and, 3. Meta Slider (for all the slideshows). I also created a customized user interface so the owner could change the content himself, able to add new pictures, event flyers, new drink specials, etc. I also took the photos and some video for the new website, shooting and editing the footage to help develop the rebranding.

Overview
A Brooklyn bar changing its vibe from a jazz bar to a gay/queer friendly bar, appealing to a younger artsy crowd that enjoys drag shows and affordable drinks. Create an attractive, fun and lively website with easy access to information.

Challenges

The old website had too much scrolling on the front page. The users were complaining that the drink specials weren’t explicit. In general, information on the old website wasn’t being displayed clearly and where it was expected to be found. They also wanted to incorporate a list of affordable drink, plus create a place to list events: queer rock parties, drag shows, and art events.

A major challenge that presented itself during the design process was the client wanting to rebrand the site while keeping the existing photographs and color pallet of the old site. This made it very difficult to create a new look. The color pallet didn’t reflect what it was actually like to be in the space during an event or appeal to the new crowd and so ultimately new photographs and a new color pallet were needed.

Lastly, the owners wanted a website that would not only reflect all these changes, with all info easy to access, but also easy to maintain in-house, without monthly maintenance costs.

Process and Insight

	Manager Interview:
The manager was interviewed to understand who would be the target patron for the website and to determine exactly what would be expected from the website. The manager was also asked to select 5 bar websites, or any websites, and discuss what he liked and didn’t like about each. He was also asked to described what he liked and didn’t like about the bar’s current website.

Open/Close Card Sort
An Open/Closed Card Sort was conducted to assess what was important and how information should be grouped on the website. The manager was given 15 cards on which to write key words and then group them into 5 basic categories of information. Then, the manager was asked to reduce everything into 3 categories with some pre-written cards.

Mock Ups
After the interview and card sort, a basic mockup of the website was generated. The mockup explained the design and functionality of the website as was created using the three card sort categories. The manger then reviewed and provided feedback on everything, which was in-turn incorporated into the design.

Photos
Photos of the bar were taken on two different nights, showing the bar’s nightlife: the bar, an occupied patio, bartenders, the general crowd, young artists, and performers. The photos were critical in determining the new tone and vibe for the new website, and general rebranding of the bar.

Communication/Prototypes
To answer the client’s needs, clear and concise communication was established via phone and emails, with this back and forth maintained throughout the design process. Screenshots of the various pages were sent as work progressed for client’s approval.

Solutions

A simple, fun and lively design, with quick and easy access to critical information was developed. The website included a homepage with daily drink special and a photographic slideshow, plus an events page listing each nights activities, as well as, a contact page with a form to book your parties. In general, the new website aesthetically reflects the patrons they want to attract, a young gay artist and performer set local to the surrounding neighborhoods.

Results

While there are no specific metrics on how frequent the website is accessed or how it has improved the bar’s business, I’ve received extremely positive feedback from the manager saying the owners are very pleased with the design. People use the website for drink price information, checking for upcoming events, as well as, directions. In fact, they estimate that the new website is getting an equal share of traffic to the bar’s Facebook page.
