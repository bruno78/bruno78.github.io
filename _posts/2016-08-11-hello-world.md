It took a while but finally my page is here. The entire process was not easy but nonetheless fun and challenging. I think I've learned a lot in the past couple weeks and this is a product of persistence, long hours reading and looking for answers to many problems that came on the way. Still a lot of room from improvement and this is just the beginning. I can't wait to see what lies ahead. I thank to all of my friends who helped me in this journey from the bottom of my heart.

yours truly,

Bruno
